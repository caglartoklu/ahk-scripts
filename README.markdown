# ahk-scripts

[AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/)
scripts I have written.

Please note that, these are not full blown applications.
Some of them are very specific to some applications,
versions and even languages.
There is a strong possibility that a script in this repository may work
on a system, but not on another.

It is also possible they will behave differently with different keyboard layouts.

So please use them at your own risk.

See the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/caglartoklu/ahk-scripts/blob/master/LICENSE)
file.

Home page: https://github.com/caglartoklu/ahk-scripts


## Installation

Copy the corresponding script to a directory of your choice,
and run it.


## Supported Environments

Windows 7 and Windows 8 has been used for testing.
But, almost all of the scripts here automate some applications/platforms,
so the exact supported environment varies from script to script.
Better to check the source code for the exact results.

Tested with AutoHotkey 1.1.13.01.


## Security

Some antivirus software will report the Windows binaries for these scripts as malicious software,
such as [this one](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/61342-comodo-reports-autohotkeynet-as-malware/).
It is a false positive, they are not.
If you are suspicious, simply download the source code in `.ahk` format,
then compile them yourself, or simply use them in their source code form.


## Usage

Simply run the corresponding script.

Some of them are triggered by special hotkeys,
some of them do their thing when they are executed.

Please see the source code of the corresponding script.


## Script Index

### [youtube-dl-helper.ahk](https://github.com/caglartoklu/ahk-scripts/tree/master/youtube-dl-helper)

[youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) is an incredible video downloader
supporting a ton of online services.

To use it, copy the video URL to clipboard, switch to `cmd.exe` as you would with
`youtube-dl` and type `y22` to download the video in high definition.
`y22` will expand to this, waiting for you to press `ENTER`:

    youtube-dl -t --write-description -f 22 -- "<WHATEVER FROM THE CLIPBOARD>"

The script will perform when the hotstrings are used.

Reference:

### [recyclebin-shredder-using-mcafee.ahk](https://github.com/caglartoklu/ahk-scripts/tree/master/recyclebin-shredder-using-mcafee/recyclebin-shredder-using-mcafee.ahk)

When executed, it shreds Windows Recycle Bin using McAfee's Shredder,
since McAfee Live Save - Internet Security 12.8 does not place such a
right click menu to the Recycle Bin.


### [firefox_save_in_archive.ahk](https://github.com/caglartoklu/ahk-scripts/blob/master/firefox/firefox_save_in_archive.ahk)

[Download firefox_save_in_archive.exe](http://caglar.toklu.co/d/firefox_save_in_archive.exe)

When executed, it overrides `ctrl-s` (only when Firefox is active)
by sending `alt-f` key for file menu and press `g` for `Save Page In Archive As`.

Firefox does not have a `Save Page In Archive As` method by default.
This menu item comes with the
[Mozilla Archive Format](https://addons.mozilla.org/En-us/firefox/addon/mozilla-archive-format/)
add-on.
Since `Save Page In Archive As` menu item does not have a shortcut,
this little script provides one by overriding `Save Page As`.

Here is a screenshot for the menu structure:
